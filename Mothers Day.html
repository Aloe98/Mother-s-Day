        <p>I relearned a tiny bit of HTML to create this. I thought it would be cool to gift you these NFC tags so you can program things like connecting to the wifi. If people come over and don't have access to the wifi, they can tap a tag and then connect to the wifi! I hope you find it cool! I can help you program some stuff like turning the lights on and off in the living room, or opening links.</p>
    <p> I love you!</p>

    <p>P.S. Thank you so much for being amazing! I don't show much affection or really show my emotions but I do love you a lot and I think you are an amazing mom to the three of us :)! I promise to ask you out to get food sometime!</p>
